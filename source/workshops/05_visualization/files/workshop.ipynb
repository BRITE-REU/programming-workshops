    "# Introduction\n",
    "## The Data Set\n",
    "In today's workshop, we will revisit the data set you worked with in the Machine Learning workshop. As a refresher:  this data set is from the GSE53987 dataset on Bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lanz TA, Joshi JJ, Reinhart V, Johnson K et al. STEP levels are unchanged in pre-frontal cortex and associative striatum in post-mortem human brain samples from subjects with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. PLoS One 2015;10(3):e0121744. PMID: 25786133\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a microarray data on platform GPL570 (HG-U133_Plus_2, Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array) consisting of 54675 probes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw CEL files of the GEO series were downloaded, frozen-RMA normalized, and the probes have been converted to HUGO gene symbols using the annotate package averaging on genes. The sample clinical data (meta-data) was parsed from the series matrix file. You can download it **here**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In total there are 205 rows consisting of 19 individuals diagnosed with BPD, 19 with MDD, 19 schizophrenia and 19 controls. Each sample has gene expression from 3 tissues (post-mortem brain). There are a total of 13768 genes (numeric features) and 10 meta features and 1 ID (GEO sample accession):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age\n",
    "- Race (W for white and B for black)\n",
    "- Gender (F for female and M for male)\n",
    "- Ph: pH of the brain tissue\n",
    "- Pmi: post mortal interval\n",
    "- Rin: RNA integrity number\n",
    "- Patient: Unique ID for each patient. Each patient has up to 3 tissue samples. The patient ID is written as disease followed by a number from 1 to 19\n",
    "- Tissue: tissue the expression was obtained from.\n",
    "- Disease.state: class of disease the patient belongs to: bipolar, schizophrenia, depression or control.\n",
    "- source.name: combination of the tissue and disease.state\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop Goals\n",
    "This workshop will walk you through an analysis of the GSE53987 microarray data set. This workshop has the following three tasks:  \n",
    "    1. Visualize the demographics of the data set  \n",
    "    2. Cluster gene expression data and appropriately visualize the cluster results\n",
    "    3. Compute differential gene expression and visualize the differential expression\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task has a __required__ section and a __bonus__ section. Focus on completing the three __required__ sections first, then if you have time at the end, revisit the __bonus__ sections. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as this is your final workshop, we hope that you will this as an opportunity to integrate the different concepts that you have learned in previous workshops.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop Logistics\n",
    "As mentioned in the pre-workshop documentation, you can do this workshop either in a Jupyter Notebook, or in a python script. Please make sure you have set-up the appropriate environment for youself. This workshop will be completed using \"paired-programming\" and the \"driver\" will switch every 15 minutes. Also, we will be using the python plotting libraries matplotlib and seaborn. "

    "## TASK 1: Visualize Dataset Demographics  \n",
    "### Required Workshop Task:  \n",
    "##### Use the skeleton code to write 3 plotting functions:  \n",
    "    1. plot_distribution()  \n",
    "        - Returns a distribution plot object given a dataframe and one observation\n",
    "    2. plot_relational()\n",
    "        - Returns a distribution plot object given a dataframe and (x,y) observations  \n",
    "    3. plot_categorical()\n",
    "        - Returns a categorical plot object given a dataframe and (x,y) observations\n",
    "##### Use these functions to produce the following plots:\n",
    "    1. Histogram of patient ages\n",
    "    2. Histogram of gene expression for 1 gene\n",
    "    3. Scatter plot of gene expression for 1 gene by ages \n",
    "    4. Scatter plot of gene expression for 1 gene by disease state \n",
    "Your plots should satisfy the following critical components:  \n",
    "    - Axis titles\n",
    "    - Figure title\n",
    "    - Legend (if applicable)\n",
    "    - Be readable\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Bonus Task: \n",
    "1. Return to these functions and include functionality to customize color palettes, axis legends, etc. You can choose to define your own plotting \"style\" and keep that consistent for all of your plotting functions.  \n",
    "2. Faceting your plots. Modify your functions to take in a \"facet\" argument that when facet is an observation, the function will create a facet grid and facet on that observation. Read more about faceting here:\n",
    "Faceting generates multi-plot grids by __mapping a dataset onto multiple axes arrayed in a grid of rows and columns that correspond to levels of variables in the dataset.__  \n",
    "    - In order to use facteting, your data __must be__ in a Pandas DataFrame and it must take the form of what Hadley Whickam calls “tidy” data. \n",
    "    - In brief, that means your dataframe should be structured such that each column is a variable and each row is an observation. There are figure-level functions (e.g. relplot() or catplot()) that will create facet grids automatically and can be used in place of things like distplot() or scatterplot(). "

    "You've seen clustering in the previous machine learning workshop. Some basic plots were generated for you, including plotting the clusters on the principle componets. While we can certainly do more of that, we will also be introducing two new plots: elbow plots and silhouette plots.\n",

    "### Elbow Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Elbow plots are plots that are used to help diagnose the perennial question of K-means clustering: how do I chose K? To create the graph, you plot the number of clusters on the x-axis and some evaluation of \"cluster goodness\" on the y-axis. Looking at the name of the plot, you might guess that we're looking for an \"elbow\". This is the point in the graph when we start getting diminished returns in performance, and specifying more clusters may lead to over-clustering the data. An example plot is shown below.\n",

    "![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/DataClustering_ElbowCriterion.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the K selected (K = 3), is right before diminishing returns start to kick in. Mathematically, this point is defined as the point in which curvature is maximized. However, the inflection point is also a decent -- though more conservative -- estimate. However, we'll just stick to eye-balling it for this workshop. If you would like to know how to automatically find the elbow point, more information can be found [here](https://raghavan.usc.edu/papers/kneedle-simplex11.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2a: Implement a function that creates an elbow plot\n",

    "\n",

    "- Generate plot data by clustering the entire dataset on the first 50 principle components. Vary K values from 2 - 10.\n",
    "    - While you've been supplied a helper function for clustering, you'll need to supply the principle components yourself. Refer to your machine learning workshop along with the scikit-learn [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html)\n",

They are created by finding the [silhouette coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering)) for each sample in the data, and plotting an area graph for each cluster. The silhouette coefficient measures how well-separated clusters are from each other. The value ranges from $[-1 , 1]$, where 1 indicates good separation, 0 indicates randomness, and -1 indicates mixing of clusters.  An example is posted below.\n",
