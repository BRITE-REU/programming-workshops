In this workshop, we will focus on learning how to load packages, import data, perform exploratory analysis with built in functions as well as functions from packages installed, performing differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data with the DESeq2 package, and visualizing the results using ggplot2.

# Install and load packages
We will begin by loading the necessary packages: 

Go ahead and install these packages using install.packages():

readr

ggplot2

dplyr

magrittr

We will use packages from the bioconductor repository, which provides tools for analysis of high-throughput genomic data.
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")

Use bioclite("package_name") function to install packages SummarizedExperiment, DESeq2 and airway.


```{r "install", eval = FALSE}
packages <- c("readr", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "magrittr")
install.packages(packages, dependencies = TRUE)

if(!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
      install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(version = "3.15")
   
BiocManager::install("SummarizedExperiment", dependencies = TRUE)
BiocManager::install("DESeq2", dependencies = TRUE)
BiocManager::install("airway", dependencies = TRUE)

```

Load these libraries using library("package_name") function:

```{r "setup", eval = FALSE}

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
library(SummarizedExperiment)
library(DESeq2)
library(airway)

```

If you have not downloaded the R_Workshop folder already, please do that now. 

Let's begin first by setting our working directory. Set your working directory to where the R_Workshop folder is located on your computer.

```{r "set working directory", eval = FALSE}
#Find working directory
getwd()

#Set working directory path
setwd("/Users/tanyatk/Desktop/R_Workshop/")

#Check working directory again
getwd()
```


Today we will work with the airway dataset. This data set comes from an RNA-Seq experiment, a high throughput sequencing method, on four human airway smooth muscle cell lines treated and untreated with dexamethasone. We will work with read counts or expression matrix for this dataset (i.e. processed files). 

Note: The sequencing files of this experiment are available on the GEO database with GEO Series Number GSE52778, and can be downloaded using SRA toolkit.

Use the read.csv("file") function import the airway_scalecounts.csv (count data) and airway_metadata.csv (meta data) files from the downloaded folder R_Workshop.

```{r 'import files'}
# Use  read.csv() function to import airway_scaledcounts.csv and airway_metadata.csv files into R
```

Use base functions to describe and look at the airway data: scaledcounts and metadata.

dim() - Dimensions

head() - Print first lines of data

tail() - Print last few lines of data

str() - Describe data object structure and information


```{r 'check data'}
# Use base functions to gain an initial view of the data
```

# Working with `data.frame` objects

Looking at `scaledcounts` we can see that the first column, "ensgene", gives the gene identifier for each gene, while each successive column gives the expression values for each gene. 

```{r 'indexing by column'}
# Use the `ensgene` column to extract the gene expression values for "ENSG00000002549".
```

This is okay, but a little clunky. Alternatively we can set the gene identifiers as row names to index rows directly.

```{r 'index by rowname'}
# 1  Set the gene identifiers to row names in `scaledcounts`.
# 2  Remove the `ensgene` column.
# 3  Extract the gene expression values using the string "ENSG00000002549" directly.
```

### Asking R for help

Alternative to steps 1 + 2 above, we could have set gene identifiers to row names when we read in the file. 

```{r 'assign rownames'}
# 1 Look up the help page for `read.csv()` using `?read.csv`, scroll down to the `row.names` in the "Arguments" section.  

# 2 Use these instructions to reread in `scaledcounts` and set the gene identifiers to row names automatically.
```

# Working with `matrix ` objects

The main difference between a `data.frame` object and a `matrix` object is that each column of a `data.frame` is free to have it's own format, whereas all values within an entire `matrix` must have the same format. One nice thing about `matrix` objects is that functions in R can be applied to all values at once. Note, that after setting the gene identifiers to row names, each value in `scaledcounts` is now a number. 

For gene expression it is common to work with log-scaled count data because these tend to adhere more closely to normal distributions than unscaled count data.  The one caveat to this that log(0) = -Inf. To overcome this, it is common practice to add a small value prior to performing log-transformations, most commonly by adding one to every value, log(1) = 0. This is referred to as a **pseudocount**.

```{r 'make a matrix'}
# 1 Use the `as.matrix()` function to convert `scaledcounts` to a matrix.

# 2 Add a pseudocount to every value.

# 3 Use the `log2()` function to log-scale the matrix.
```

# Running simple comparative statistical analyses

Later in this workshop, we will use a robust Bioconductor package to run differential gene expression analysis.  The basis for this type of analysis is common when analyzing high-throughput data. It has the following steps...

1. Extract the expression values for a single gene.
2. Run compare the mean expression between two groups using a statistical test.
3. Repeat steps 1 + 2 for every gene.

### Running one test

The t-test is a common choice for performing a differential analysis. Next we will perform a simple differential test comparing treated and control groups in our gene expression data. The "dex" column in `metadata` gives group values for treated and control samples.

```{r 'ttest', eval = FALSE}
# 1 Create a new data.frame called `genedata` with two columns: 1) log-transformed expression values of "ENSG00000002549" and 2) group values from the "dex" variable. Call the columns "ex" and "group", respectively. 

# 2 Run the following to use the `t.test()` function to compare the log transformed expression values between treated and control samples with pooled variance (var.equal = TRUE).
ttestRes <- t.test(ex ~ group, data = genedata, var.equal = TRUE)
```

Note that the syntax at the begining of this function, you will see it a lot.  Look up ?formula for more information. This is common in functions for statistical modelling, as well as base R plotting functions.  For example, instead of running a t-test we could run a linear model.

```{r 'linear model', eval = FALSE}
lmRes <- lm(ex ~ group, data = genedata)
print(summary(lmRes))
```
Note, that the p-value for the linear model is equal to the p-value for the t-test.  This is because simple linear regression models are equivalent to a t-test with pooled variance.

We can use a similar syntax to create boxplots of the expression values for either group with the `boxplot()` function.

```{r 'boxplot', eval = FALSE}
boxplot(ex ~ group, data = genedata)
```
As we can see, the difference in mean is very small relative to the variance, hence the large p-value.

### Wrapper functions

What if we want to run a t-test on any gene? We can greatly reduce the amount of code we need to write by writing a function that takes a gene identifier as an argument, runs the t-test, and returns information we are interested in. For example, below is a function that takes the arguments, `geneid` and returns a vector with two values: the difference in mean and p-value.

```{r 'wrap ttest', eval = FALSE}
# Function to run ttest for a given gene ID
ttestGene <- function(geneid) {
    
    # Create data matrix
    genedata <- data.frame(ex = scaledcounts[geneid,], group = metadata$dex)
    
    # Run t-test
    ttestRes <- t.test(ex ~ group, data = genedata)
    
    # Get difference in mean
    diffMean <- ttestRes$estimate[2] - ttestRes$estimate[1]
    
    # Get difference and p-value
    results <- c(diffMean, pvalue = ttestRes$p.value)
    
    # Given these values a name
    names(results) <- c("diff", "pvalue")
    
    return(results)
}

# Run it on "ENSG00000002549"
ttestGene("ENSG00000002549")
```

### Apply loops

We can run this analysis using an apply loop.  In are there are several choices of apply loops, for this case we will use the `sapply()` function.  `sapply()` takes two arguments: a vector and a function. You may want to check the help page, `?apply`, for other options. `sapply()` takes every value of a vector and **applies** it to the first argument of the function argument.

```{r 'run a loop'}
# 1 Run sapply for the first 1000 genes in `scaledcounts` using their names and the `ttestGene()` function.  Write the ouput to an object called `res`.
# 2 Transpose the output with t().
```

### Matrix operations

Loops are great and often necessary, but whenever possible utilizing matrix operations is a great way to speed up runtime. The maximum likelihood estimates of linear regression coefficients can be estimated using the following formula, $$\hat{\beta} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty.$$ Here, X is and $N\times P$ matrix of variables, and $y$ can be a vector of outcome variables, in this case gene expression values for specific gene. $X^T$ denotes that a given matrix is transposed and $()^{-1} denotes taking the inverse of the items in the parenthesis.

```{r 'create a design', eval = FALSE}
X <- model.matrix(~ group, data = genedata)
print(X)
```

The three basic matrix operations functions in R are:
1.  `t()`: Transpose matrix input.
2.  `solve()`: Take the inverse of matrix input.
3.  `%*%`: Multiply matrices on the left and right.

```{r 'blue matrix'}
# 1 Use the formula for the maximum likelihood estimates of linear regression coefficients above to generate the difference in mean of log transformed expression values between treated and control samples for "ENSG00000002549". 
```

In actuality, $y$ need not be a vector, but instead a $N \times Q$ matrix, where $Q$ is a set of variables for which you'd like to indepedently test the relationships to $X$. 

```{r 'y is a matrix'}
# 1 Use the formula for the maximum likelihood estimates of linear regression coefficients above to estimate the difference in log transformed expression values between treated and control samples for the first 1000 genes in `scaledcounts`.
```

# Loading data from an R package

This data set is also available in a package called "airway" in bioconductor. It is saved as an S4 object (object oriented programming) that contains the count data, meta data, and other information important to the data in fields or slots in the object. To load the airway data we can use the data("data_name") function and call airway to add the dataset to our workspace.

You'll notice that the class is called RangedSummarizedExperiment (i.e. an S4 object), which is used to store matrices of experimental results such as the count data and meta data. This class is from the SummarizedExperiment package which is used often to store sequencing and microarray data.

```{r 'load airway data from bioconductor package'}
# Call airway data using data() and print airway data to save to workspace
```

Since we imported the same data set twice, we can remove data from our workspace using the rm() function.

Let's remove the variables scaledcounts and metadata from our workspace. We'll keep the airway object since it will be easier to work with for downstream analysis.

```{r 'remove extra files'}
# Remove scaledcounts and metadata variable
```


Let's first do some preliminary work with the airway dataset. The sample/metadata information is saved under the slot colData which can be extracted using airway@colData or colData(airway). 

First check the data structure of the colData(airway) dataset.

Hint: Built in functions to check data structure

Let's set colData(airway) as a data frame. 

Hint: We will use the as.data.frame() function to do this. 

```{r 'change data structure'}
# Check mode of colData(airway) and make change the structure to a data frame.
```

The count data is saved under the slot assay. We can extract the count matrix by calling airway@assay or assay(airway). We can also use descriptive statistics to look at the expression acrosss samples. We will sum the expression of each column and scale by 1e6 to get scaled expression value. We will then use the summary() function to look at the range of expression between the samples. 

Determine a way to sum the expression of each column.

Hint: You can use a for loop, apply function, or base functions such as colSums()

```{r 'statistics of expression'}
# 1 Sum the expression of each column, divide by 1e6

# 2 Use summary function to see the range of values between each sample
```


We will use DESeq2 package for differential expression analysis of the airway data set to find differentially expressed genes between untreated and treated samples. We will first load DESeq2 and set up the data to be compatible with DESeq by using the function DESeqDataSet(). 

We can use the help("function_name") or ?function_name to look up the function to get a description.

A description or help pages will show up under the Help tab in the bottom right corner.

```{r 'help function'}
# Look up DESeqDataSet() function description 
```

We can also go to the bioconductor page for DESeq2 and look at the manual for functions as well as a tutorial of using the package itself. Click here to see the [page](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html)

The function DESeqDataSet includes an argument called design which asks for a formula that expresses how the counts for each gene depends on the variables in colData. In this case we choose variables cell and dex because we care about the cell line and which samples are treated with dexamethasone versus which samples are untreated controls.  

```{r 'set up DESeqDataSet', eval = FALSE}
DE_airway <- DESeqDataSet(airway, design = ~ cell + dex)

DE_airway
```


Before we continue, we must set our control group as our reference level for comparison in our differential expression analysis. 

```{r 'reference level', eval = FALSE}
DE_airway@colData$dex <- relevel(DE_airway@colData$dex, ref = "untrt")

```


Now we wil; run the differential expression analysis steps through the function DESeq(). Again we can look up the function to learn more about what it does and the arguments needed to run it. We use the results() function to generate a results table with log2 fold changes, p values and adjusted p values for each gene. The log2 fold change and the Wald test p value is based on the last variable in the design formula, in this case variable dex. Therefore our results will show which genes are differentially expressed between the untreated and treated groups.  

```{r 'Run DE Analysis', eval = FALSE}
help("DESeq")

DE_airway <- DESeq(DE_airway)
res <- results(DE_airway) 

head(res)
```


How do we order the results table (res) based on the p-value? 
There are already available functions in R that we can use to sort the dataframe.
Hint: Use function order() to order the rows based on p-value

```{r 'order res', eval = FALSE}
# Use order() to order the results table based on the p-value
```


In DESeq2, the function plotMA generates an MA Plot commonly used to visualize the differential expression results. The plot shows the log2 fold changes attributable to a given variable over the mean of normalized counts for all the samples in the DESeqDataSet. Points represent genes and will be colored red if the adjusted p value is less than 0.1. Points which fall out of the window are plotted as open triangles pointing either up or down.

```{r 'MA Plot', eval = FALSE}
plotMA(res, ylim=c(-2,2))
```


Let's add a column that tell us whether each gene is significant. Using the mutate() function from library dplyr, we can add a column showing whether the significance is TRUE or FALSE based on cutoff padj < 0.01.

```{r 'Add signicance column', eval = FALSE}
# Change res to a tibble format to work with dplyr

res <- tbl_df(res)

# Add sig column to show which genes are significant or not by using mutate() from dplyr

res <- mutate(res, sig=padj<0.01)

# We can use the symbol %>% from library magrittr to represent a pipe. Pipes take the output from one function and feed it to the first argument of the next function. You may have seen something similar in unix with |

res <- res %>% mutate(sig=padj<0.01)

head(res)
```


Let's use the filter() function from dplyr to filter out results based on padj < 0.01, and write this to a csv file using write_csv() function from readr.

Try using piping format %>% to do this!

```{r 'Filter and save file', eval = FALSE}
# Filter res based on cutoff padj < 0.01 and save this result into a csv file called significant_results.csv
```



What if we want to generate our own plots? We can use ggplot2 to create our own volcano plot of the differential expression results between the untreated and treated groups. 

Now let's try generating a volcano plot using ggplot2?

Hint: log2FoldChange for x-axis, -1*log10(pvalue) for y-axis, sig to color the points.

Make sure to include argument for points and include the title "Volcano plot"

Bonus: Change the axis titles to something more readable and change the point shapes, or play around with any other parameters to get a feel for how ggplot2 works.  

```{r 'ggplot volcano plot'}
# Create Volcano plot using ggplot2
```


How would you generate the same MA plot above using ggplot2? 
Hint: Use baseMean for x-axis, log2FoldChange for y-axis, sig for color. 

Make sure to have points and to use a log10 scale for the x-axis (i.e. scale_x_log10() ).

Add the title "MA plot" to your plot as well.


```{r 'ggplot MA plot'}
# Create MA plot using ggplot2
```

# Gene Set Enrichment using enrichR

Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a method to identify classes of genes that are over-represented in a large set of genes. This is performed by comparing the input gene set with annotated gene sets from online functional databases such as `Gene Ontology (GO) <http://geneontology.org>`_ and `KEGG <https://www.kegg.jp>`_. This is a common step in bioinformatics as it aids with the biological interpretation of results.

In this section of the workshop, we will perform GSEA on the set of differentially-expressed genes we identified earlier in this workshop using the `enrichR <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4987924/>`_ tool. Please note that this section will require a working internet connection.

Let's start by keeping only the set of genes that showed statistically-significant change in expression between conditions. Remember from the  previous section that our threshold is be a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1 (i.e. no more than 10% chance that the observed change in expression is due to chance). Not all the genes in the results from DESeq2 were assigned  p-values so we'll start by filtering out the genes without p-values followed by storing the significant genes separately.

```{r}
# 1 Filter out  genes with no p-values

# 2 Keep significant genes only

# 3 How many significant genes did we get?
```

There's one more step before we carry out GSEA. The genes in this dataset use Ensembl indentifiers, while enrichR expects  gene symbols. We'll use the biomaRt package to map our Ensembl IDs to gene symbols.

```{r}
# 1 Load package (remember to install it if you haven't)

# 2 Load human reference genome

# 3 Map Ensembl IDs  to gene symbols (might take a couple of minutes)
```

Now that we have our correctly-formatted gene symbols, we can perform GSEA. There are many different databases we can use for  this step; for this workshop we will  use the Gene Ontology (GO) databases: GO Biological Process, GO Molecular Function, and GO Cellular Component.

```{r}
# 1 Find the list of all available databases from Enrichr

# 2 Scroll through list of available databases

# 3 Set up list with databases of interest

# 4 Perform GSEA

# 5 Check first few results for the biological process database
```



To conclude, we can look at our session information including the packages we loaded and worked with.
```{r 'session info', eval = FALSE}

sessionInfo()

```
