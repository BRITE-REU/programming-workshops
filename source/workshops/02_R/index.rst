Workshop 4: R and RStudio
===========================


**R and RStudio**
In this online workshop you will learn the R programming language, RStudio interface for programming in R, and useful tips for exploring and working with data.

You are expected to study the the following content:

- `Introduction and Data Structures <Intro_R.html>`_
- `Exploring Data in R <Explore_R.html>`_

Here is a link to a very useful `Base R Cheat Sheet <https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/base-r.pdf>`_ that is good to keep handy (maybe you can have a printed version for yourself).

In the workshop, we will work with RNA-Seq data and perform differential analysis.
