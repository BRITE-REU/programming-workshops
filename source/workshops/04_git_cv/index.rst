Workshop 4. Reproducible Research Using Git + Snakemake
=======================================================

In this workshop you will learn about two tool, git and Snakemake, that promote
reproducible research in computation sciences through version control and workflow
management, respectively.

You are expected to study the materials and go over the ``git``,  ``GitHub``, 
and ``Snakemake`` tutorials before the workshop. You will also need an account on
`GitHub <https://github.com>`_ before the workshop. In the hands-on workshop you
will develop an analysis pipeline while documentating changes on Github, so it is
important that you have a basic understanding of both tools.
