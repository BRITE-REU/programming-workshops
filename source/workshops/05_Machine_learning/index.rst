Workshop 5: Machine Learning 
============================================

This workshop provides a basic introduction to machine learning. 
First we will talk about data preparation and exploration. 
Then we will introduce a general pipeline for unsupervised and supervised learning. 

You are expected to study the the following content:

* `Dataset exploration and validation <dataset.html>`_
* `Learning models <learning.html>`_
    - `Unsupervised learning <unsupervised_learning.html>`_
    - `Supervised learning <supervised_learning.html>`_


In the workshop, do some basic data exploration and modeling.
